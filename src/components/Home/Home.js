						The choice of paper size is one of the first of any given work to be printed. There are two basic paper size systems in the world: the
						international A sizes, and the American sizes.
					</p>
					<p>
						The international Standard paper sizes, called the A series, is based on a golden rectangle, the divine proportion. It is extremely
						handsome and practical as well. It is adopted by many countries around the world and is based on the German DIN metric Standards. The
						United States uses a basic letter size (8 1/2 x 11‚Äù) of ugly proportions, and results in complete chaos with an endless amount of paper
						sizes. It is a by-product of the culture of free enterprise, competition and waste. Just another example of the misinterpretations of
						freedom.
					</p>
					<p>
						These are the basic DIN sizes in mm. for : A0, 841x1189 - A1, 594x841 - A2, 420x594 - A3, 297x420 - A4, 210x297 - A5, 148x210 - A6, 105
						x148 - A7, 74x 105 - A8, 52x74 - A9, 37x52 - A10, 26x37.
					</p>
					<p>
						The A4 is the basic size for stationary. Two thirds of it is a square, a nice economical happenstance resulting from the golden
						rectangle. It is one of the reasons we tend to use as much as possible the DIN sizes: proportions are always leading to other nice
						proportions.
					</p>
					<p>
						This does not happen with the American basic size which leads to nothing. I counted 28 different standard sizes in USA!. The only reason
						we use it is because everybody in USA uses it, all stationary in USA is that size, so are manilla folders, les and of ce equipment! The
						repercussion of ugliness is endless.
